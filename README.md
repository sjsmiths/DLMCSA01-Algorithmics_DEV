# Algorithmics-Scripts

This repository gathers the script snippets
of the course's script.

They are grouped by chapter and sequenced by their appearance.

Scripts are generally of two types:

- example scripts which one can read, run, and possibly adapt to understand an aglorithm
- self-check exercises where the actual algorithm is yet to be written but a method fo check the algorithm is provided

Note that the example scripts may give rise to some re-use: 
E.g. make available a JS module whose classes can be re-used by subsequent scripts, even in a later chapter.
The best example for this is probably the set of datastructures' functions.

The scripts here may suffer of one problem, as opposed to pseudocode: some syntactic or software-management issues may appear (e.g. the import of libraries). It is hoped that the conciseness of JavaScript makes this nuisance rather small.
