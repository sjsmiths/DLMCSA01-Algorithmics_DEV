# Algorithmics-Scripts

This repository gathers script snippets from the script for the IUBH Fernstudium course DLMCSA01 Algorithmics.

They are grouped by unit and sequenced by their appearance.

Except where noted, all scripts can be run simply by invoking `node file.js` and are followed by a dialog.

Students are strongly encouraged to run the scripts, modify them, and run them again. Using a debugger may help understanding the program flow.

The scripts here may suffer from one problem, as opposed to pseudocode: some syntactic or software-management issues may 
appear (e.g., the import of libraries). The conciseness of JavaScript should ideally make this a rather small nuisance.

System requirements: These scripts have been tested with NodeJS 12.
