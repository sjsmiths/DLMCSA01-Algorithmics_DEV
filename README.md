# Algorithmics-Scripts

This repository gathers the script snippets of the script of the course DLMCSA01 Algorithmics of the IUBH Fernstudium.

They are grouped by unit and sequenced by their appearance.

Except where noted, all scripts can be run simply by invoking `node file.js` and is followed by a dialog.

Students are strongly encouraged to run the scripts, modify them, and run them again. Using a debugger may help understanding the program flow.

The scripts here may suffer of one problem, as opposed to pseudocode: some syntactic or software-management issues may 
appear (e.g. the import of libraries). It is hoped that the conciseness of JavaScript makes this nuisance rather small.

System requirements: These scripts have been tested with NodeJS 12.
